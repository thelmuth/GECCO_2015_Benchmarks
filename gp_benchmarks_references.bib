  abstract =	"Genetic programming (GP) is not a field noted for the
		 rigor of its benchmarking. Some of its benchmark
		 problems are popular purely through historical
		 contingency, and they can be criticized as too easy or
		 as providing misleading information concerning
		 real-world performance, but they persist largely
		 because of inertia and the lack of good alternatives.
		 Even where the problems themselves are impeccable,
		 comparisons between studies are made more difficult by
		 the lack of standardization. We argue that the
		 definition of standard benchmarks is an essential step
		 in the maturation of the field. We make several
		 contributions towards this goal. We motivate the
		 development of a benchmark suite and define its goals;
		 we survey existing practice; we enumerate many
		 candidate benchmarks; we report progress on reference
		 implementations; and we set out a concrete plan for
		 gathering feedback from the GP community that would, if
		 adopted, lead to a standard set of benchmarks.",
