\section{Introduction}



\section{Methods}


\section{Problem Requirements}

- specifications as examples

- non-trivial -- challenges typical of general programming by humans, as well as the types of problems weâ€™d want a general program synthesis system to perform

The first is that the problems are non-trivial, and present challenges typical of real general program synthesis applications. The goal of any benchmark problem is to measure the characteristics of a system on a problem that mimics some aspects of the real applications on which it is expected to function. In order to test general program synthesis from examples, we want to choose benchmark problems that require a range of programming constructs and data types. Additionally, they should require a variety of sizes and shapes for solution programs, not limited to artificially small programs. Such a benchmark suite will not likely include problems that provide significant difficultly for advanced human programmers, but should at least prove challenging to new programmers.

- unbiased (toward a particular synthesis method)




\section{Problems}
To fulfill the requirements... chose problems from intro CS classes



\subsection{Descriptions - iJava}

In this section, we will describe the problems from iJava \cite{iJava, Moll:2011:IOI:1968521.1968535}. We used version 3.1 of the text---some problems might have different numbers or might not appear in other versions. Each problem has the question or project number that inspired it beside it.

\subsubsection*{1. Number IO (Q 3.5.1)}
Given an integer and a float, print their sum.

\subsubsection*{2. Small or Large (Q 4.6.3)}
Given an integer $n$ in the range $[-10000, 10000]$, print "small" if $n < 1000$ and "large" if $n \ge 2000$ (and nothing if $1000 \le n < 2000$).

\subsubsection*{3. For Loop Index (Q 4.11.7)}
Given 3 integer inputs $start, finish,$ and $stepSize$, print the integers represented by the Java for loop: \\
\texttt{for(i = start; i < finish; i += stepSize) \\ \- \- \- \- System.out.println(i);}

\subsubsection*{4. Compare String Lengths (Q 4.11.13)}
Given three strings $n1$, $n2$, and $n3$, return true if $length(n1) < length(n2) < length(n3)$, and false otherwise.

\subsubsection*{5. Double Letters (Project 4.1)}
Given a string, print the string, doubling every letter character, and tripling every exclamation point. All other non-alphabetic and non-exclamation characters should be printed a single time each.

\subsubsection*{6. Collatz Numbers (Project 4.2)}
Given an integer, find the number of terms in the Collatz sequence starting from that integer.

\subsubsection*{7. Replace Space with Newline (Project 4.3)}
Given a string input, print the string, replacing spaces with newlines. Also, return the integer count of the non-whitespace characters. The input string will not have tabs or newlines, but may have multiple spaces in a row.

\subsubsection*{8. String Differences (Project 4.4)}
Given 2 strings (without whitespace) as input, find the indices at which the strings have different characters, stopping at the end of the shorter one. For each such index, print a line containing the index as well as the character in each string. For example, if the strings are ``dealer'' and ``dollars'', the program should report this: \\
\texttt{\centerline{1 e o} \\
\centerline{2 a l} \\
\centerline{4 e a}}

\subsubsection*{9. Even Squares (Q 5.4.1)}
Given an integer $n$, print all of the positive even perfect squares less than $n$ on separate lines.

\subsubsection*{10. Wallis Pi (Projet 6.4))}
John Wallis gave the following infinite product that converges to $\pi/4$:
\[
(2/3)\times(4/3)\times(4/5)\times(6/5)\times(6/7)\times(8/7)\times(8/9)\times(10/9)...
\]
Given an integer input $n$, compute an approximation of this product out to $n$ terms. Results are rounded to 5 decimal places.

\subsubsection*{11. String Lengths Backwards (Q 7.2.5)}
Given a vector of strings, print the length of each string in the vector starting with the last and ending with the first.

\subsubsection*{12. Last Index of Zero (Q 7.7.8)}
Given a vector of integers, at least one of which is 0, return the index of the last occurrence of 0 in the vector.

\subsubsection*{13. Vector Average (Q 7.7.11)}
Given a vector of floats, return the average of those floats. Results are rounded to 4 decimal places.

\subsubsection*{14. Count Odds (Q 7.7.12)}
Given a vector of integers, return the number of integers that are odd. (DOES NOT INCLUDE AN EVEN OR ODD INSTRUCTION. SHOULD WE SAY THIS?)

\subsubsection*{15. Mirror Image (Q 7.7.15)}
Given two vectors, return true if one vector is the reverse of the other, and false otherwise.

\subsubsection*{16. Super Anagrams (Project 7.3)}
Given strings $x$ and $y$ of lowercase letters, return true if $y$ is a super anagram of $x$, which is the case if every character in $x$ is in $y$. To be true, $y$ may contain extra characters, but must have at least as many copies of each character as $x$ does.

\subsubsection*{17. Sum of Squares (Q 8.5.4)}
Given integer $n$, return the sum of squaring each integer in the range $[1, n]$.

\subsubsection*{18. Vectors Summed (Q 8.7.6)}
Given two vectors of integers, return a vector of integers that contains the sum of the input vectors at each index.

\subsubsection*{19. X-Word Lines (Project 8.1)}
Given an integer $X$  and a string that likely contains spaces and newlines, print the string with exactly $X$ words per line. The last line may have fewer than $X$ words.

\subsubsection*{20. Pig Latin (Project 8.2)}
Given a string containing lowercase words separated by single spaces, print the string with each word translated to pig Latin. More specifically, if a word starts with a vowel, it should have ``ay'' added to its end; otherwise, the first letter is moved to the end of the word, followed by ``ay''.

\subsubsection*{21. Negative To Zero (Q 9.6.8)}
Given a vector of integers, return the vector where all negative integers have been replaced by 0.

\subsubsection*{22. Scrabble Score (Project 10.1)}
Given a string of visible characters, return the Scrabble score for that string. Each letter has a corresponding value according to normal Scrabble rules, and non-letter characters are worth zero.

\subsubsection*{23. Word Stats (Project 10.5)}
Given a file, print the number of words containing $n$ characters for $n$ from 1 to the length of the longest word, in the format:
\texttt{ \\
words of length 1: 12 \\
words of length 2: 3 \\
words of length 3: 8 \\
... \\
} %this looks terrible -- is there something better?
At the end of the output, print a line that gives the number of sentences, and line that gives the average number of words per sentence, using the form:
\texttt{ \\
number of sentences: 4 \\
average sentence length: 7.452423455 \\
} %this looks terrible -- is there something better?
A word is any string of consecutive non-whitespace characters (including sentence terminators). Every input will contain at least one sentence terminator (period, exclamation point, or question mark). The average number of words is the number of words in the file divided by the number of sentence terminator characters.


\subsection{Descriptions - Repair Paper}

In this section, we will describe the problems from the Repair Paper \cite{ManyBugsAndIntroClass, Brun13TRgptest}. These problems have the same names in those papers, so no problem number.

\subsubsection*{24. Checksum}
Given a string, compute the integer values of the characters in the string, sum them, take the sum modulo 64, add the integer value of the space character, and then convert that integer back into its corresponding character (the checksum). The program must print \texttt{Check sum is X}, where $X$ is replaced by the correct checksum character.

\subsubsection*{25. Digits}
Given an integer, print that integer's digits each on their own line starting with the least significant digit. A negative integer should have the negative sign printed before the most significant digit.

\subsubsection*{26. Grade}
Given 5 integers, the first four represent the lower numeric thresholds for achieving an A, B, C, and D, and will be distinct and in descending order. The fifth represents the student's numeric grade. The program must print \texttt{Student has a X grade.}, where $X$ is A, B, C, D, or F depending on the thresholds and their numeric grade.

\subsubsection*{27. Median}
Given 3 integers, print their median.

\subsubsection*{28. Smallest}
Given 4 integers, print the smallest of them.

\subsubsection*{29. Syllables}
Given a string containing symbols, spaces, digits, and lowercase letters, count the number of occurrences of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) in the string and print that number as $X$ in \texttt{The number of syllables is X}.

Omitted for blind review.

%
% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{gp_benchmarks_references}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
%APPENDICES are optional
%\balancecolumns
%\appendix
%%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A ' for the \TeX\ Expert}
%\subsection{Conclusions}
%\subsection{Acknowledgments}
%\subsection{Additional Authors}
%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the
%\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
%then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
%to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
%the .tex source file and comment out
%the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
%% This next section command marks the start of
%% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
%\section{More Help for the Hardy}
%The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
%and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
%experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
%it useful but please remember not to change it.
